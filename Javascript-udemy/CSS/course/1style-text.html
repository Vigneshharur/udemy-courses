       <h1>Kingdom of Denmark</h1>
       <p>Denmark (Danish: Danmark, pronounced [ˈtænmɑk] ⓘ) is a Nordic country in the central portion of Northern Europe. It is the metropolitan part of and the most populous constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark,[N 8] a constitutionally unitary state that includes the autonomous territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland in the North Atlantic Ocean.[14] Metropolitan Denmark[N 9] is the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries, lying south-west and south of Sweden, south of Norway,[N 10] and north of Germany, with which it shares a short border, Denmark's only land border.</p>
        <p>As of 2013, the Kingdom of Denmark, including the Faroe Islands and Greenland, had a total of 1,419 islands greater than 100 square metres (1,100 sq ft) in area; 443 of these have been named and 78 are inhabited.[15] Spanning a total area of 42,943 km2 (16,580 sq mi),[16] metropolitan Denmark consists of the northern part of the Jutland peninsula and an archipelago of 406 islands.[17] Of these, the most populated island is Zealand, on which the capital and largest city, Copenhagen, is situated, followed by Funen, the North Jutlandic Island, and Amager.[18] Denmark has flat, arable land, sandy coasts, low elevations, and a temperate climate. It had a population of 5,964,059 (1 December 2023), of whom 800,000 live in Copenhagen (2 million in the wider area).[19] Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving powers to handle internal affairs. Home rule was established in the Faroe Islands in 1948 and in Greenland in 1979; the latter obtained further autonomy in 2009</p>
