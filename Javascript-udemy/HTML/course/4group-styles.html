        <h1>Moon</h1>

        The Moon is in geophysical terms a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. 
        It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of 
        Earth's or with 3,474 km (2,159 mi) about as wide as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it 
        is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive
         and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets.[18] 
         Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after 
         Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon 
         is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field.
          It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a 
          giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.

       <h1>Jupiter</h1>

       alt = "Jupiter" class="planet-image" >

       <p class="planet-text">
        Jupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System 
        impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter is primarily composed of 
        hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which makes up a quarter of its mass and a tenth 
        of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet 
        receives from the Sun. Its internal structure is believed to comprise an outer mantle of liquid 
        metallic hydrogen, and a diffuse inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rotation rate 
        of 1 rotation per 10 hours, Jupiter's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable 
        bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, 
        with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this 
        is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier.

       <h1>Earth</h1>

       <p class="planet-text">
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
        This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid 
        surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of 
        Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the 
        form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's 
        land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar 
        deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. 
        Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, 
        volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of
         deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.</p>
